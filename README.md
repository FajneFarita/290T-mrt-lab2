Follow the prompts in the Jupyter notebook, filling in the places marked with "TODO."

You can submit your assignment in two ways:
1. Fork this repository and commit changes to your fork. Submit a link to your repo on BCourses.
2. Submit a .zip file of this working directory on BCourses.

You know the drill by now - have fun!
